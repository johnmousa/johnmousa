# Enterprise guide to analytics capabilities: A journey for data-driven insights and innovation

What successful organization have in common is driving outcomes and value based on the insights and leanings from data. In this session we navigate enterprise data driven journey through a model of self improvement, going from initial analytical capabilities stage, through functional and finally to data driven and fostering continuous innovation.

As enterprises scale in size and engage in business model innovation, extracting insights becomes complex and the process to do so mirrors this complexity. As an enterprise architect, you also face the challenges of navigating multiple concepts where decisions are impacted by the fear of “missing out“ or ”lock in“. In this talk we use a model to guide you around data platform architecture patterns and capabilities. I also present how to use the model to architect for reversible decisions and scale multiple platforms as the data landscape grows. Through model we’ll explore what’s needed to support the business in its scalable data-driven journey towards innovation.
