### For those times when you need more than 1 server, or none (by John Mousa & Stefan Christoph) +++
Scaling in modern distributed architectures is often hard to get right. Over time we keep adding abstraction and decoupling components that add complexity to maintainability and operations. Yet, today’s business challenges are demanding more operational excellence, resilience, scale with cost-effective solutions. If you find this balance hard to strive for, we think so too, but we have your back. Join Stefan and John from AWS showing scalable cloud architectures that don’t break your bank, and simplify your operational landscape along the way. We’ll show how to approach modern service architectures and patterns with serverless solutions that are simple to understand and operate.

#### About John
John Mousa is an engineer at heart and for the past 16 years or so have been building micro services and backends for variety of organizations. Since he joined AWS, he works on building bridges between the worlds of services and big data and analytics. He constantly finds his passion on enabling customers with their data strategy in their journey to become insights and data driven.
He currently enables top digital retailers in Germany, alongside digital native business and enterprises customers world wide as a Sr. Solutions Architect at AWS. Outside of work, he loves to spend time with his family and play video games.

In addition to cloud technologies and broad expertise in software development, his focus is on machine learning and artificial intelligence. He currently works predominantly with customers in the media & entertainment and AdTech industry.

### Advanced integration patterns & trade-offs for loosely coupled systems (by Dirk Fröhner) +++
Modern applications rarely live in isolation: They expose APIs, publish events, call third-party services, and externalize states. Being (typically) composed of decoupled components, such applications must address the fundamental challenges of distributed systems, including out-of-order delivery, idempotence, or partial failures. In this session, learn about common design trade-offs for distributed systems, and how to navigate them with design patterns.

#### About Dirk
In his role as Principal Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services, Dirk Fröhner supports enterprise customers to reach their goals better using the cloud, push ahead digitalization, and allow more space for innovation. For this, he contributes his wealth of experience in backend development, software architecture, devops principles, and knowledge of human nature - all of which he built up during 20+ years of professional experience. In his spare time, Dirk is a pain-resistant supporter of Schalke 04.
