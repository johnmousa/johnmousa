# Silos To Data-Driven Culture: A Modern Data Strategy Model

During times of uncertainty, data-driven decision making is key to create a long-term competitive advantage. Despite this, recent studies show that only 30% of organizations reported success with their data initiatives! It’s challenging to navigate many patterns for modern data platforms, and now distributed data-meshes where decisions are impacted by the fear of “missing-out“ or ”lock-in“.

In this session we take a journey through a model of evolving business and analytical capabilities. By the end of the session you’ll be able to use different patterns to integrate data across silos, platforms, and organizations using AWS services enabling successful business-differentiating initiatives.
