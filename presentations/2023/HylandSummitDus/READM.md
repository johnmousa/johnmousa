What successful organizations have in common is driving outcomes and value based on the insights from data. In this session we navigate an organization’s journey to become data driven through a model of self-improvement, going from initial analytical capabilities stage, through functional and finally to data driven and fostering continuous innovation. 

We explore patterns for data extraction, data lakes and lake house architectures, and finally distributed data architectures with practical examples. .
