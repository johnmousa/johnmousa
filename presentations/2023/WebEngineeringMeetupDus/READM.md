# Streaming analytics for time series data that does not choke

The perfect test for a realtime data architecture, is how to cope with time series data from millions of devices at a heartbeat rate. In this talk you’ll see how to combine streaming services to build near-realtime insights pipelines for smart devices and telemetry data at scale. We’ll allow machine learning and analytics on data at scale without provisioning a single server using AWS serverless services. You’ll see how to use Amazon Kinesis and Apache Flink to extend the data to Data Lakes on Amazon S3 for machine learning applications and Amazon Timestream at the same time for realtime monitoring with Grafana.
