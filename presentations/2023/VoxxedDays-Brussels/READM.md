# Analytics capabilities architectural patterns: A journey for data-driven insights and innovations

What successful organizations have in common is driving outcomes and value based on the insights from data. In this session we navigate enterprise data driven journey through a model of self-improvement, going from initial analytical capabilities stage, through functional and finally to data driven and fostering continuous innovation. We explore patterns for data extraction, data lakes and lake house architectures, and finally distributed data meshes with practical examples.

With all these patterns, as an architect, you face the challenges of navigating multiple concepts where decisions are impacted by the fear of “missing out“ or ”lock in“. In this talk we use a model to guide you around data platform architecture patterns and capabilities. I also present how to use the model to architect for reversible decisions and scale multiple platforms as the data landscape grows. The goal is to support the business in its scalable data-driven journey towards innovation.
